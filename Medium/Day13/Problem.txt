One day, Ronaldo stumbled upon a curious puzzle that piqued his interest.
It involved discovering special sets of integers, which he fancifully named "Binary Bouquets".
Each bouquet was represented by an N-tuple, denoted as (B1, B2, ..., BN). However, in Ronaldo world, these tuples were akin to arranging binary blossoms!

Each "blossom" in the bouquet had its unique petals, ranging from 0 to 2^M - 1, with M symbolizing the magic number of petals.
The challenge lay in arranging these binary blossoms so that when their petals were combined using the bitwise AND operation, the result would always be 0.
It was as if Ronaldo was orchestrating a symphony of zeros and ones on the field of numbers.

As Ronaldo dove deeper into the puzzle, he realized the immense possibilities it presented. The number of Binary Bouquets seemed endless,
and he was determined to find a way to count them efficiently.

Driven by his passion for both the game and the puzzle, Ronaldo embarked on a quest to conquer this riddle.
With his sharp mind and mathematical acumen, he sought a method to calculate the count of Binary Bouquets modulo 10^9 + 7,
ensuring his solution remained within bounds.
